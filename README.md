# Overworld Coordinates

Ever had to manually calculate your portal positions for them to line up? Needed a better solution?\
Not anymore!

## What this mod does

It adds a new line for horizontal coordinates in the scale of the overworld.\
The only dimension in vanilla this mod affects is the nether (with a scale of 8), but it will work with any custom dimension utilising coordinate scales!\

## Dependencies

None! It works out of the box.
Although BetterF3 is recommended for a better experience.
